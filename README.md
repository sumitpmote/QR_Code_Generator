**QR Code Generator Script**                                                                                                                                         
This Python script generates a QR code for a given URL (in this case, Amazon India), customizes its appearance, and saves it as an image file.

Import Required Libraries:                                                                                                                                             
qrcode: A library for generating QR codes.                                                                                                                           
Pillow (PIL): Used here for working with images, as qrcode integrates with it for image handling.                                                                    
NOTE: Ensure you install the qrcode and Pillow modules before importing them.

You can customize this script to suit your needs! Replace the URL with any link you want to convert into a QR code.              
Additionally, you can modify the colors, border size, and box size to create a QR code that matches your preferences.
